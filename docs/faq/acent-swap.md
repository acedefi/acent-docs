# Swapping ACE for ADE

## Swap schedule

All the Acent tokens are not delivered right from the launch.  

Here is the schedule [extracted from the official white paper](https://acent.tech/whitepaper)  


## Swap ACE to ADE - daily limits (until August 10th)

Normally, ACENT can be swapped to ADE on any of these chains: Ethereum, BSC.  

Team may announce that on a particular days, only a part of the chains are supported, follow their announcement on Telegram https://t.me/AcentChannel

Between August 3rd and August 10th, there is a daily limit on how much RELAY is available to swap: The supply is distributed across all chains supporting the swap.  
When the swap can start on a particular day (typically from 2pm EST) and the supply of one chain has been depleted: You can cross chain your ACENT to another chain, to try swapping to ACENT on another chain (https://acent.tech).

After August 10th, all the remaining ACENT will be available to swap until September 12th, without any daily limit.


## How to swap ACE to ADE

Go to the page https://acent.tech 
It's a 2 step process: Approve the swap request, then do the swap.  

A video tutorial can be downloaded at . 



Note for the period between August 3rd and August 10th:
* If the Acent tokens were depleted at the time of the swap attempt, swap transaction was pending until timing out by itself.  
Team decided once to supply more tokens on some chains, so pending transactions still went through for some users..
