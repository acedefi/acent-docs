## Baas (Bridging as a Service)

[Building a bulletproof multi-chain BaaS](https://www.youtube.com/)

Bridging as a Service is a phrase that was coined by Acent Swap. The goal with BaaS is to allow any project to use our bridge to go cross chain all natively to their app and with the same look and feel for users to feel familiar. This allows our partners to connect their project, platform or ecosystem to another EVM compatible blockchain or other even other none evm blockchains that we support such as dot.
We haved designed this white labelled BaaS integration so that partners can easily introduce their projects to other supported ecosystems quickly and safely.

## Supported chains  

Currently:  

1.  ** Ethereum **
1.  ** BSC **

**If you feel like leaving the members of the team that work on this documentation a tip**

Tokens can be cross-chained from any of these chains to the others.  
Based on the number of chains supported, there are 20 possible bridges between chains today with a possibility to grow to over 100 in the near future.

## Cross chain/bridging fees

The fees that are paided to use the Acent Swap bridges will depend on which chain your liquidity lives on and is trying to move to:

From Ethereum to another chain: 0.056 ETH


From BSC to another chain: 0.07 BNB


Fees are paid in the gas token you use the Acent Swap bridge to move from. For example, if you bridge tokens from the Ethereum to the Avalanche chain, the transaction fees will be paid in ETH and would cost the above fee in Ethereum.

## Questions regarding fees from recent AMA's

Q: Do we have to pay any fees when we use your bridge? Furthermore, how is the revenue being generated for the project itself which can be used to finance future developments?

A: currently the fee is appox $10, this will move to dynamic in the future proportional to the amount you are bridging, but there will be a cap as well. we want to make sure both small and large portfolio traders can use the bridge while still incentivizing our token holders and liquidity providers
